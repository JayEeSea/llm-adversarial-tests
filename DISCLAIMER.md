# DISCLAIMER

This repository is maintained for research, analysis, and educational purposes within the context of defence, security studies, and AI safety.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to evaluate how large language models (LLMs) respond to prompts related to adversarial behaviour, strategic misuse, disinformation, and other critical edge cases relevant to national security and defence applications. It supports the development of safer, more robust AI systems by identifying potential vulnerabilities, failure modes, and response inconsistencies across different models and configurations.

## Content Notice

Some test cases may involve:
- Hypothetical or simulated examples of malicious use (e.g. disinformation, manipulation, or prompt injection)
- Politically or ethically sensitive topics (e.g. war crimes, state propaganda, or coercive strategy)
- Analysis of outputs that, in other contexts, may be considered harmful or controversial

These prompts and responses are included **solely for the purpose of controlled testing and documentation**, and **do not represent the views, beliefs, or intentions of the author, contributors, or affiliated institutions**.

## Responsible Use

- No part of this repository is intended to facilitate or promote real-world harm, deception, or unethical behaviour.
- Prompts are designed with clear research objectives and are not intended to be used outside of controlled testing environments.
- Users must take responsibility for any derivative work or repurposing of the contents.
- Raw model outputs are presented as-is and do not imply accuracy, endorsement, or agreement.

## Legal and Ethical Compliance

All work in this repository is conducted in accordance with:
- Applicable laws governing AI research and publication
- The ethical principles of academic and defence-related inquiry
- The responsible disclosure of observed model behaviour without enabling abuse

If you believe any content poses a risk or violates legal or ethical norms, please raise an issue or contact the maintainer directly.
